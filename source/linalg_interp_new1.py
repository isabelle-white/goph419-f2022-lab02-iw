    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array-like, shape = (n,n)
        This contains the coefficient matrix 
    b : array-like, shape = (n,m) with m â‰¥1 
        This is the right-hand-side vector(s)
    x0 : (optional) array-like, shape = (n,m) or shape = (n,)
        This is an optional kwarg with a default value of None. If no x0 value is imputted 
        the inital guess is taken as all zeros and results in an array. 
        
        If x0 is provided it can either be the same shape as b or a single column vector
        with the n rows. 
        If it is the same shape as b: use x0 directly to find the ouput array.
        If it is a column vector: repeat to initialise an output array with m columns.
    
    This contains the initial guess(es). 
    
    tol : (optional) float
        Relative error tolerance (stopping criterion)
    alg : (optional) string
        This is a flag for the algorithm to be used

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray, shape (n,m)
    This is the solution to the system array 
    
    Raises 
    -------
    Value Error: 
    This is the error that will be shown if alg contains a string that does not say which 
    method to use. 
    This is also shown if the shape of A, b and/or x0 do not meet the criterion set.
    
    Type Error:
    This is the error shown if string-like methods are used on alg. 
    
    RuntimeWarning: 
    If the system does not converge before a previously set number of iterations this 
    will alert the user and stop the algorithm.
